## **Hi, I'm Gloria!**

ðŸŽ“ **Senior at San Jose State University studying Computer Science.**

ðŸ”­ **Aspiring machine learning engineer!**

Iâ€™m passionate about applying machine learning theory to real-world 
problems through data analysis and predictive modeling. Since beginning
my ML journey through Break Through Tech AIâ€™s program, Iâ€™ve been steadily 
building my skills in both foundational theory and hands-on implementation. 
Currently, Iâ€™m delving into machine learning theory from a statistical 
perspective while experimenting with a wide range of models and modeling
techniques. Iâ€™m excited to continue growing through practical, 
industry-level experiencesâ€”whether in an ML internship or in a full-time role
as an ML engineer.

ðŸŽ¯ **FEATURED PROJECT: Happiness Predictor for Countries**

**What I Did:** Preprocessed and analyzed features from the 2018 World Happiness Report
(WHR) dataset using standard ML packages such as Pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, 
etc., then built a KNN regressor (w/ GUI) and Random Forest Model (w/o GUI) to predict 
happiness scores (on a scale from 0-10). 

**Tools:** JupyterLab, Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib + seaborn, NumPy, Gradio

**Result:** 

* *KNN:* * R^2: 0.86, RMSE: 0.41
  
* *Random Forest:* * R^2: 0.88, RMSE: 0.395

âœ¨ **FUN FACT:**

I love coconut coffee lattes and chocolate-flavored FairLife shakes! 
These are my go-to beverages outside of a warm cup of green tea or
plain water.
